Description
------------------------------
This utility is intended to decode binary form of SII save files (saves from
truck games developed by SCS Software) into their textual form.

At this moment, the binary format specification is not publicly available. 
Information necessary for the conversion were obtained only by observing data 
patterns in existing saves, therefore the decoder is not complete and any 
conversion made by it cannot be verified. It is strongly recommended to backup
original data in case the conversion is done wrong.

The project is primarily developed in Delphi 7 Personal and Lazarus 1.6.x
(FPC 3.x) and therefore can be compiled by those development tools. It should be 
also possible to compile it in newer versions of mentioned tools/compilers.
This utility can be compiled into both 32bit and 64bit binaries.
